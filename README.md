### 📌 About the Project
This project predicts the current market price of used cars based on features like brand, manufacturing year, kilometres driven, fuel type, and more. Using Linear Regression, the model helps buyers and sellers estimate fair pricing for new and pre-owned vehicles.

### 📂 Dataset Features
|Feature|Description|Type|
|-------|-----------|----|
|Car Name|Brand and model of the car|Categorical|
|Year|Manufacturing year|Numerical|
|Selling Price|Previous selling price (used)|Numerical|
|Driven Kms|Total kilometers driven|Numerical|
|Fuel Type|Petrol, Diesel, CNG, etc.|Categorical|
|Selling Type|Dealer, Individual, etc.|Categorical|
|Transmission|Manual or Automatic|Categorical|
|Owner|Number of previous owners|Numerical|
|Present Price|Current market price (Target)|Numerical|

### 🛠️ Tech Stack & Libraries
- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

### Key Steps
- ✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Statistical insights & visualizations
- ✅ Data Preprocessing – Handling missing values, encoding categorical data, feature scaling
- ✅ Model Training – Linear Regression for price prediction
- ✅ Evaluation – Performance metrics (R², RMSE)
- ✅ Prediction – Estimating present car prices

### 🔍 Key Insights from EDA
📌 Year vs. Price: Newer cars have higher present prices.
📌 Fuel Type Impact: Diesel cars are generally priced higher than petrol.
📌 Low Mileage Effect: Cars with fewer kilometers driven have better resale value.
📌 Manual vs. Automatic: Automatic cars tend to have a slightly higher price.

#### 📊 Correlation Analysis
|Feature|Correlation with Present Price|
|-------|------------------------------|
|Selling Price|	0.91 (Very Strong)|
|Transmission|0.53 (Strong)|
|Driven Kms|0.38 (Moderate)|
|Year|-0.015(Negative)|

### 📝 Conclusion & Business Impact
- ✔ Strongest Price Drivers: Selling price & Fuel Type.
- ✔ Mileage Matters: High kilometer readings reduce resale value.

#### Future Improvements:
- Try Random Forest / XGBoost for better accuracy.
- Include more features like car condition, location, etc.
